=> First milestones <=

- Users can sign up for an accountand select their level preference (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- Users can see friends online, and invite for an exchange (f2f or online in tandem with a video sevice)
- Users take turns discussing topics in their target langugaes for 3min rounds. These include games (such as 20 questions), general discussion points, and current events.
- Each user has a unique view within the game session. The user who is currently prasctising their target lagugae will recieve hints and vocab. If its a guessing game, one user will see an item on their screen, while the other player will ecieve clues to help them discover it.
- Users can pause the languguage exchange, and skip questions.

=> Future milestones <=

- The progress of users is tracked, and completed topics saved so no user will get the same question twice.
- User subject preferences can be defined to ensure the topics are interesting to both users.
